# <Daily Calendar>

## Description
My motivation was to design a calendar that would allow me to document what I have to do throughout the day and keep track of what events and times have already passed. It helped me learn a lot about javascript and how to utilize more for loops. I was also able to learn from the code that I had written and understand and dive into where some of the issues were at. It solves the problem of having just a simple planner with no information on it. Compared to mine where it will change colors based on what times have passed.

## Installation

All you need to do is open the github pages application and it will display my calendar!

## Usage
For this Calendar website, I had to utilize many elements such as jquery and moment.js in order to incorporate features such as formatting and time. I created my code with simplicity in mind in order to make it easy to read while completing the tasks needed by the user. It now successfully changes colors based on the time(red in the past, grey for the present, and green for the future). It also stores whatever is written in the time slots to an ID card and puts it into local storage to be further called upon.
